If you want to get up and running as an active signer as quickly as possible, here is a list of the commands you need to run and actions to take.

If you are not familiar with how signing works yet, be sure to check out the [Signing concept guide](https://app.gitbook.com/s/H74xqoobupBWwBsVMJhK/block-production/signing).
